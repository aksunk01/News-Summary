The goal of this project is to web scrape articles from different news websites and have Google's Gemini provide a summary of all of the collected articles, articles are curated by topic. The Ai generated summary would then be sent to a discord server for users to see. There are many different applicaitons for this such as compiling a paragraph that contains almost all views pertaining to a specific topic. This allows the user to be the most informed while gaining insights to all the different viewpoints in said topic
